The PDB is the main repository for 3D structure data of biomolecules

Here we explore it's composition. We obtained the most recent states from https://rcsb.org/stats/summary

```{r}
tbl <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
tot.method <- colSums(tbl)
round(tot.method/tot.method["Total"] *100,digits = 3)
```
X-ray = 87.197%, Electron Microscopy = 5.354%

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
ans <- tbl$Total/sum(tbl$Total)*100
round(ans,3)
```

The answer to this question is `r round(ans,3)` % of total structures.

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Here is a VMD generated image of HIV-protease, PBD code: 1hsg

## Bio3D package for structural bioinformatics

We will load the bio3d package.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```


Extract the sequence for ADK:

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
#blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
#hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
#hits$pdb.id
```

## Normal mode analysis (NMA)

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1ake")
pdb
```

Trim to chain A only.

```{r}
chain <- trim.pdb(pdb, chain = "A")
chain
```

Run a bioinformatics method to predict the flexibility and "functional motions" of this protein chain.
```{r}
modes <- nma(chain)
```

```{r}
plot(modes)
```

```{r}
m7 <- mktrj.nma(modes, mode=7, file="mode_7.pdb")
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1ake")
chain <- trim.pdb(pdb, chain = "A")
modes <- nma(chain)
mktrj.nma(modes, mode=7, file="mode_7.pdb")
```
